\section{Introduction}

Open-source software development is often a highly collaborative activity, and effective communication 
between members and coordination of tasks is critical for a successful project. 
Historically, mailing lists have been the preferred medium for coordinating development
and user support activities\cite{Vasilescu14StackOverflow}. In recent years however, 
developers are moving away from mailing lists as the preferred means of communication.
Replacing the mailing lists are a number of social media sites, we will focus on the the following;
Reddit\footnote{\texttt{http://www.reddit.com}}, HackerNews\footnote{\texttt{https://news.ycombinator.com}},
StackOverflow\footnote{\texttt{http://www.stackoverflow.com}} and GitHub\footnote{\texttt{http://www.github.com}}.
\\Social media has changed the landscape of the internet in several ways, and developers are taking advantage of this with employing new methods
in the development. In this report our focus will be on the role social
media sites play in software development. Initially, we will describe some of the most common
websites used for open-source development, also briefly present relevant 
litterature on the subject and finally discuss our findings.

\subsection{Research question}
\begin{quote}
\textit{How does social media influence communities involved in open source software development?}
\end{quote}


\subsection{Focus and important terms}
Before we continue, it is important to define some of the key terms we will be employing
in this essay. 
%Overkill med subsubsection kanskje?
\subsubsection{Social media}
Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define social media as "a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content."\cite{Kaplan201059} Some examples of social media applications are FaceBook, Twitter and Tumblr.
\subsubsection{Open source development}
%Insert well defined description of FOSS(fra pensum?)
The focus in this essay will be on how social media influences open software development. To assess
this we have chosen some focus points that we feel are representative in FOSS. 

\begin{description}
  \item[Exposure] \hfill \\
  A typical FOSS project does not have access to traditional means of
  promotion or advertisement. This fact is problematic because the community
  aspect of FOSS development is critical. Therefore a project needs a way to
  attract users as well as contributors to the project.
   \item[Knowledge base] \hfill \\ In any project, there is a need to
	share and keep track of knowledge. Documentation is not usually
	sufficient to cover this requirement by itself.
	\item[Development tools] \hfill \\
	Practically all software projects
	require some form of collaboration tools, such as Version Control
	Systems (VCS) and Issue (Defect) Trackers. FOSS projects have a
	compounded need for good such tools, since the developers mostly
	are geographically distributed and cannot collaborate face to
	face. 

\end{description}

\section{Central social media sites}

\subsection{Reddit}

Reddit is a social networking and news site that allow users to submit content
such as links or text content. The site does not itself host multimedia content,
but users provide links with interesting content from sites like YouTube\footnote{\texttt{http://www.youtube.com}}, Imgur\footnote{\texttt{http://www.imgur.com}} and
SoundCloud\footnote{\texttt{http://www.soundcloud.com}}.
Reddit is organized by a collection of categories or 'subreddits'. 
The subreddit for programming(\texttt{r/programming}) consists of about \num{500000}
subscribers. %% The way Reddit works is by a voting system that works in a way that
%% ‘good’ content becomes more visible, and ‘bad’ content is displaced.
Reddit works by a voting system that prioritizes 'good' content, and 'bad'
content is displaced. This way, if a website is prominently displayed it means that
many people have voted on it as a interesting piece of content.

Reddit has a high number of users, around 175 million
unique users every month. Because of this huge number of users it has 
the potential to generate huge traffic spikes, this is sometimes referred
Reddit also functions as sort of a funnel for traffic, where the ‘good’
content quickly rises to the top of the page, resulting in more
traffic. This in turn spikes traffic on the site that hosts this content,
sometimes resulting in what is know as the ‘Reddit hug of death’, where a
small website hosting popular content crashes due to the spike in traffic
generated by Reddit. %% As such, Reddit functions as a tastemaker in new and
%% interesting content.


We will not do any investigation into non-technical subreddits, nor discuss
any of them. We do think technical subreddits have an effect on CBPP, but we
have no reason to believe that less technical subreddits (like
birdswitharms) have any impact on CBPP.

\subsection{Hacker News}
The news aggregator HackerNews is a social news website that caters to
programmers and entrepreneurs. In a similar in structure to Reddit, Hacker
News uses ‘upvoting’ as a way to ensure quality content is displayed most
prominently on the site. The absence of a 'downvote', along with more
comprehensive guidelines\footnote{\texttt{https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html}},
makes the community perhaps more stable, compared to Reddit.


\subsection{StackOverflow}

The social Q\&A website for programmers, hobbyists, students or anyone
seeking technical advice. StackOverflow has quickly become the number one
place to seek information related to programming related problems. On the
website users submit a question and ‘tags’ it with relevant categories.
Similarly to Reddit posts are up- or down-voted by other users. If a
submitted question is too similar to an already answered thread, it may be
merged, or if the question is badly worded or too banal, it may be
deleted. If a question avoids these pitfalls, it may be answered by
anyone. Quality responses that many users find useful will be upvoted to the
top, and the user who submitted that answer will be awarded ‘rep points’ to
indicate his/hers level of expertise. This reward system is frequently used
in similar social websites, and is a form of ‘gamification’.
%this aspect will be explored more detailed in the final submission.
%% Dette må vi huske på!

\subsection{GitHub}

GitHub is a Git repository web-based 
hosting service which offers its users
repositories for revision control and source control management. The site
has gained popularity by providing powerful tools, whilst staying easy to
use. It revolves around Git which is an free and open source distributed
source control management system, and plays a large role in teaching how to
use the system. Since it’s no less powerful than it’s predecessors, but is a
lot easier to use, we suspect it has lowered the bar to start making
contributions to open sourced projects. For all public repositories the
service is free, and in this way it pays a large contribution to open source
development. One can also keep a private repository on their server, but
this is in exchange for a fee. The site has by 2014 grown to be the largest
code host in the world, and has over 3,4 million users. In 2013 Github
announced that they had reached 10 million public repositories, which
accumulates to a very large contribution to the open source community.

\section{Related works and opinions}

Traditionally, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects have
relied upon mailing lists as the primary means of communication in
their communities. %CITEHERE%

Over the last several years, however, there has been a shift in the
way communication happens on the Internet, with the advent of the
Social Networks such as Facebook, Twitter and reddit. The latter, and
other special interest social media sites like Hacker News, have seen
particularly high adoption rates amongst software developers and power
users, also for relatively technical discussions.
% Kan jeg si det?

Additionally, several services which one would consider part of Social
Media have been launched that are specifically aimed at software
development, such as GitHub and StackOverflow, amongst many others.

% CITE \/
There has been quite a bit of research into FOSS projects and their
organizational behaviour, but much of this work may be starting to
show its age and has very much been centered around mailing lists
(such as \cite{Oezbek10Cancer, singh2011network}) and centralized (source) version
control systems. Whilst mailing lists undoubtedly remain a very
important communication channel for most projects, they are being
challenged by social media and community behaviour may be changing
because of it.

While research into social media is quite hot, its intersection with
software development, and indeed FOSS projects has not seen very much
published research. However, there have been a handful of interesting
works during the last years.

In a recent case study of the R statistical programming language's
community \cite{Vasilescu14StackOverflow}, Vasilescu et
al. demonstrate how that project has seen a marked migration from
traditional FOSS community support in the form of a mailing list, to
community support through the Social Q\&{}A site
StackOverflow. StackOverflow is built around the concept of
gamification\cite{deterding2011game} which appears to actually have
changed the behaviour of community members. Through correlating email
addresses, the authors showed that a significant number of informating
providers (community members who answer questions) participated in
both the mailing list and on StackOverflow, and that the same
individuals would tend to answer much faster on the latter site. This
can be explained by the fact that on StackOverflow, good answerers are
rewarded with points, prominently displayed to other community
members. Thusly, they may feel more motivated to provide timely
responses to questions posed there, since the reward is higher.


StackOverflow has a very defined communication form, questions and
answers. Therefore it is very suited to typical support/knowledge
sharing activities. It is harder to imagine such benefits of
gamification applied to less didactic communication, such as technical
deciision making, design issues, etc. These discussions will tend to
be conducted among peers, whilst support usually is between knowledge
seekers and providers, who are not equal. Furthermore, there may be no
``right'' answer, so awarding points and such would be very
difficult. For these reasons, it is likely that sites such as
StackOverflow will merely serve as a supplement to traditional mailing
lists (or similar fora).


The increasing popularity and migration to distributed version control
systems (dCVS) is also, in some cases, changing the way code actually
makes it way into projects. Examples of dCVS are Git, Mercurial
(coloquially known as Hg) and Bazaar. These have in common that they
are less reliant on a single point of coordination during active
development, which can make it much easier for small time contributors
to work on code changes, since they can work locally under source
control, or even set up third party repositories synchronized with the
upstream.

Github not only offers gratis\footnote{Github's services are free of
  charge for publically available repositories} hosting of Git dCVS
repositories, but also provides a number of other code collaboration
tools, like a graphical web interface to Git, issue tracking and code
review tools. This has the potential to ease the burden of starting
new projects, as well as contributing to existing ones that use
Github's platform - project instigators need not spend time on setting
up complicated infrastructure, and newcomers get access to good tools
off the bat.

It should be noted that while Github revolves around Git, which itself
is Free Software\footnote{Git is licensed under the GNU General Public
  License version 2.0}, the Github platform, including all the tools
and data generated by them, is actually proprietary. This poses a
dilemma for FOSS projects, since they may often not wish to become
reliant on proprietary software (and indeed, a whole proprietary third
party hosted platform).


FOSS projects, like all CBPP projects, are nothing without people
forming a community around it. It is from a community, generally
mostly users, that the project can recruit active contributors that
help keep it moving forward and stay alive. In order to foster a
community, projects need to be able to get word out about their
existence, and about why they are interesting.

There have been some sites dedicated to this, such as (the now
shuttered) FreshMeat, or SourceForge, in addition to the various
technical news venues. However, social media present new opportunities
in this domain. Programming/IT related subreddits, and especially
Hacker News (and other similar social media) gather a large number of
individuals with the interest and skills needed to participate in FOSS
projects, not to mention people responsible to fulfill computing
needs, either for themselves or for their employers.  On social media,
project members or anyone else are free to just post about interesting
projects, forgoing the need for editorial approval and
filtering. Usually, there is some form of crowdsourced moderation or
promotion of posts, so that content deemed interesting by many gains
more exposure. This might be an advantage for smaller projections,
especially, that do not have any brand name recognition to allure tech
journalists.

One especially interesting point is that, according to Singh et
al. \cite{singh2011network}, inter-project relationships between
developers may be quite beneficial to their success. If social media
and coding platforms can help foster such relationships, which they
would seem suited to do, this would be a big plus for the FOSS
community.

\section{Discussion}

Knowing that social media is having an effect on FOSS projects in some
ways, we would have liked to be able to investigate whether this
effect stretched into the realm of development. In particular, it's
known in the community that receiving attention on certain of the most
popular software development social medias like (parts of) reddit and
Hacker News tends to lead to heavy traffic spikes for the exposed
project. Beyond this, there is little knowledge about longer term
effects. Do projects really gain more users, and do these spikes lead
to recruitment of new contributors?

In order to attempt to answer these questions, we contacted GitHub to
inquire about the possibility of receiving some general traffic
statistics, so we would be able to detect and document the occurence
of the aforementioned social media spikes. Unfortunately, this turned
out not to be possible because of privacy issues.

\subsection{The Emacs community}

We wanted to look at a few existing projects and see how Social Media has
influenced the community and project development. We were already to some
extent a part of the Emacs community, and we thought this would make it
easier to reach out to it.

Emacs, originally developed by Richard Stallman in 1976, currently has
\num{191} active project
members\footnote{\texttt{http://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=emacs}}.
Since \num{2012} Emacs has featured it's own package manager, making
external packages more easily available. This has extended Emacs' ecosystem
beyond the development of the Emacs core, and people are increasingly
depending on external packages.

The most popular repository for external packages is
Melpa\footnote{\texttt{http://melpa.org} - at 11. November 2014} and
currently contains \num{2076} external packages; of which \num{1762} are
mirrored from GitHub and \num{220} are mirrored form
EmacsWiki\footnote{\texttt{http://www.emacswiki.org/}}. The total number of
libraries in EmacsWiki is \num{1952}, which is relatively few compared to
the swarming number of GitHub repository's, which is
\num{21152}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/search?utf8=\%E2\%9C\%93\&q=language\%3Aemacs-lisp\&type=Repositories\&ref=searchresults}{https://github.com/search} - at 11. November 2014}.

The presence of Github seems to have made a serious impact to the number of
openly available projects for this particular community. We want to argue
that this development also has an indirect effect on the development of the
core of Emacs.

Richard Stallman has spoke of the development of external packages several
times on the Emacs mailing list. His general opinion is that libraries that
other packages depend on should be included in the Emacs
core\footnote{\texttt{https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-09/msg00630.html}},
but also shows skepticism toward this
development\footnote{\texttt{https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-09/msg00582.html}}.

One consequence of external packages is that it makes changing the
interfaces in Emacs more difficult, because the maintainers has no control
over these packages. Because the copyright is held by whomever submitted the
package, the packages can't simply be included in Emacs. He also expresses
some concern that these external packages speaks against the GNU projects
values, such as recommending use of non-free software.
